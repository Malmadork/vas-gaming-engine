# vas-gaming-engine
This is a JavaScript gaming engine I am developing.


This project may not look like much right now but I plan to keep editing it and improving upon it. I plan to have the engine simplify game development for js/canvas, allow developers to create in both 2d(like platforming games) and 3d-ish(like original zelda games), and be usable for developers both experienced and beginners. 

Currently the engine simplifies shape creation(Rectangles, Circles, Lines, and Backgrounds), and allows sprite importing. I plan to release updates that allow more shapes, loops, animationd, tilemaps, and more.
